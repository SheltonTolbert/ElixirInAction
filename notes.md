Elixir in action 

## Modules
Generate a compiled file with `elixirc _filename_`

## Lists
Lists can be modified with the List and Enum Modules

- Lists are linked lists with the following structure [head | tail]
    - [1,2,3] is the same as [1,[2,[3,[4,[]]]]]
- h _list_ will return the head, 1 in the above case
- t _list_ will return the tail, [2,3,4] in the above case
- lists without another list as a tail are called improper lists and have some special use cases. ie: [1 | 'b']

### List tricks 
- pushing to a list can be done using the following syntax: 
    list = [1,2]
    new_list = [0 | list]

### Immutability
- Items in tuples share common memory: 
    t1 = {1,2,3}
    t2 = insert_at(t1,1,5)
        {1,5,2,3}
    There is only one copy of each element in memory, t1 and t2 point to the same locations

- Lists only replace the tail, the head is copied into a new memory location
    
## Maps
Maps are key/value pairs, similar to objects in Javascript of HashMaps in Java.

The syntax for creating a map is as follows: 
```elixir
iex(1)> map = %{"key" => "value", :key => :value}
%{:key => :value, "key" => "value"}}
```
Values may be retrieved from a map using the following syntax
```elixir
iex(1)> map["key"]
"value"
iex(1)> map[:key]
:value
iex(2)> map[value]
nil
```
iex(1)> Map.get(map, value, :default_value)
_:default_value_

Insert a new element with Map.put(map, key, value)

Atoms can be used as keys and provide the following special syntatic treatment:
iex(1)> map = %{this_is_an_atom: 'atoms are fun'}
iex(1)> map.this_is_an_atom
_'atoms_are_fun'_ 
iex(1)> map[:this_is_an_atom]
_'atoms_are_fun'_

Change a field with the following syntax
iex(1)> map = %{a: 1, b: 2}
iex(1)> %{map | b: 3}
{a: 1, b: 3}

The common pattern is to provide all the fields while creating the map, using atoms as keys. 
If the value for some field isnâ€™t available, you can set it to nil.

## Labmdas
```elixir
iex(1)> anon = fn x -> IO.puts(x)
iex(2)> Enum.each([0,1,2], anon)
0
1
2
```
Lambda functions can also be defined with the capture shorthand: 
```elixir
iex(1)> anon = $IO.puts/1
iex(2)> Enum.each([0,1,2], anon)
# or Enum.each([0,1,2], &IO.puts/1)
0
1
2 
```
The capture operator can also be used to shorten custom lambdas:
```elixir
iex(1)> lambda = fn x, y, z -> x * y + z end
```
is the same as:
```elixir
iex(1)> lambda = &(&1 * &2 + &3)
```

lambdas support closure

## Higher Level Types

### Range

A range is an abstraction that allows you to represent a range of numbers.

The syntax is as follows
```elixir
iex(1)> range = 1...2
```

Ranges are enumerable like a list but are implemented using a Map.
This makes range operations O(1) instead of O(n).

### Keyword Lists

A Keyword list is a special list where each element is a tuple consisting of an atom and a value of any type.

The Syntax is as follows:
```elixir
iex(1)> days = [{:monday, 1}, {:tuesday, 2}, {:wednesday, 3}]
```

The Keyword List syntax can be simplified using the following syntax:
```elixir
iex(1)> days = [monday: 1, tuesday: 2, wednesday: 3]
```

Keyword List data is accessed like a map:
```elixir
iex(2)> days[:monday]
1
```
or
```elixir
iex(3)> days.tuesday
2
```

Since a Keyword List is a just a List, the lookup complexity is still O(n).
